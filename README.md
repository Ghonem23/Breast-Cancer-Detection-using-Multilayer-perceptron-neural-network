# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Multilayer-perceptron-neural-network
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer can significantly increase the chances of successful treatment and survival. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop models that can detect breast cancer from medical images with high accuracy. In this report, we present a project that aims to detect breast cancer using machine learning techniques. The project was trained and tested on a cleaned and balanced dataset from Kaggle called “Breast Cancer Wisconsin”. An MLP classifier was used to achieve an accuracy of 0.9385964912280702. The dataset was cleaned and balanced by the author before training the model. The MLP classifier was chosen due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data and its effectiveness in binary classification problems. The program takes in various features of a patient’s breast mass such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension. These features were used to train the MLP model and predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not. The program achieved an accuracy of 0.9385964912280702 in detecting breast cancer. Precision is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus false positives. Recall is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus false negatives. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Support is the number of samples of the true response that lie in that class. Macro average is the unweighted mean of precision, recall and F1-score across all classes while weighted average is the weighted mean of precision, recall and F1-score across all classes where each class’s contribution is weighted by its support.
